# dotfiles

This directory contains initialization or configuration files for
the Shell and certain programs that use such mechanisms.

There are some tools for "dotfile management".
[GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/)
and [Dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) are two popular ones worth consideration.
I'm using homegrown shell scripts for now.

See `install` and `sudo_install`.

Some other default settings that I have found to be good:

    - For terminal window font, use 'cursor 18'
