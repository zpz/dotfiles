# Configure bash shell

On Linux, put [bashrc](./bashrc) in `/etc/` and rename it to `bash.bashrc`.

On Mac, may need a different location; to be tested.

Alternatively,
on either Linux or Mac,
put [bashrc](./bashrc) in user home directory `~` and rename it `.bashrc`,
and put [bash\_profile](./bash_profile) in `~` and rename it `.bash_profile`.

Putting this in a system location is preferred to a user location,
because the user file can have further customization on top of the system file.
