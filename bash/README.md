Because `~/.bashrc` is sometimes edited by applications behind the user's back, it is better to install the `bashrc` here into a system location, so to prevent accidental edits and to affect all users.

If there is a system default `~/.bashrc`, you may want to backup and remove it.
Create a new, empty `~/.bashrc`, and enrich it as needed.

The color settings work well in a **dark** terminal window.
