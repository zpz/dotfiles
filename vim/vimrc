  " Some nice color schemes:
  "   badwolf
  "   molokai
  "   monokai
  "   solarized (I haven't figured out how to set it up)
  "
  " Usable default colorschemes:
  "   delek
  "   desert
  "   torte

set cursorline
  " Show a visual line under the cursor's current line.
  " Some colorschemes use underlining, some others
  " (like monokai, molokai, badwolf) uses whole-line coloring.

set ruler
  " show position of cursor

" Place this block after 'colorscheme' setting
" to override the cursorline setting in the chosen colorscheme.
" Underline the current line instead of coloring it (like in
" 'monokai', 'molokai', 'badwolf').

set ttyfast
  " faster redraw
set backspace=indent,eol,start
  " Tells vim to allow backspacing over autoindents.
  " Enables backspace over the end of lines. 
  " In other words, if you are on the 1st col and press <BS>, the current line
  " will be joined with the preceding one.
  " Enables you to backspace over the start of an insert.
  " In other words, you can erase more text than you entered during a single
  " insert command.

set tabstop=4
  " tab is shown as 4 spaces visually
set softtabstop=4
  " 4-space when editing (insert and backspace)
set expandtab
  " Expand tabs into spaces
  " Insert space characters whenever the tab key is pressed;
  " this way the tab character does not get saved in the file either.
  " This is at odds with makefiles.
  " To enter a real TAB, use Ctrl-V<Tab> key sequence.
  " See also: 'au FileType make ...'
  "
  " After the 'expandtab' option is set, all new tabs entered will be changed
  " to spaces (see 'tabstop').
  " This will not affect the existing tab characters.
  " To change all the existing tab characters to match the current tab
  " settings, use
  "  :retab
  " See also: the 'expand' command (external; not in vim).
set shiftwidth=4

set autoindent
  " indent each line the same as the preceding one

set wildmenu
  " You know how Vim automatically autocompletes things like filenames when you,
  " for instance, run :e ~/.vim<TAB>? Well it will provide a graphical menu of all the matches
  " you can cycle through if you turn on wildmenu.

set hlsearch
  " This will highlight everything that matches your search as you type
  " in search patterns. Kinda too much highlighting.
set incsearch
  " Show immediately where the so-far typed search pattern is matched.
set smartcase
  " case is ingored if the search pattern entered is all lower case
"set ignorecase          " ignore case when searching
"Vim will keep highlighted matches from searches until you either run a new
"one or manually stop highlighting the old search with :nohlsearch or :noh.

  " space open/close folds
set foldlevelstart=10

" Line Shortcuts
nnoremap j gj
nnoremap k gk
  " These two allow us to move around lines visually.
  " So if there's a very long line that gets visually wrapped to two lines,
  " j won't skip over the "fake" part of the visual line in favor of the next "real" line.
nnoremap gV `[v`]
  " this one visually selects the block of characters you added last time you were in INSERT mode.

" Leader Shortcuts
let mapleader=","
  " leader is comma
"nnoremap <leader>u :GundoToggle<CR>
  " In one of its cleverest innovations, Vim doesn't model undo as a simple stack.
  " In Vim it's a tree. This makes sure you never lose an action in Vim,
  " but also makes it much more difficult to traverse around that tree.
  " gundo.vim fixes this by displaying that undo tree in graphical form.
  " Get it and don't look back. Here I've mapped it to ,u, which I like to think of as "super undo".
nnoremap <leader><space> :noh<CR>
