1. Run `install_vim.sh`.

2. Run `vim --version` to check things, especially `+lua` should appear.

3. Place `vimrc` in user home directory as `.vimrc`.  Place the content of `./vim` into `~/.vim/`.
   (A system location for config is `/usr/local/share/vim`; to be investigated later.)

4. Launch `vim`, run command `:PluginInstall`.

5. Use `vim` to edit something (e.g. Python code) to confirm that auto completion is working.

(The main reason for doing the source compilation above is to enable `lua` support
so that the plugin `neocomplete` can be used.
It seems the package `vim-nox` might achieve this effect w/o the trouble of source compilation.
To be investigated later.)
